### Game Rules
- To start the game, each player draws ten white cards.
- The player who most recently pooped begins as the Card Czar and draws a black card. If Hugh Jackman is playing, he goes first, regardless of how recently he pooped.
- The Card Czar reads the question or fill-in-the-blank phrase on the black card out loud. Everyone else answers the question or fills in the blank by passing one white card, face down, to the Card Czar.
- The Card Czar then shuffles all the answers and reads each card combination out loud to the group. The Card Czar should re-read the black card before presenting each answer. Finally, the Card Czar picks the funniest play, and whoever submitted it gets one point.
- After the round, a new player becomes the Card Czar and everyone draws back up to ten white cards.
